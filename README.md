# KUPPA overview

KUPPA is a ecommerce store built with Django.

This is for demonstation purposes only and will be used for my final Code Institute module. This is a public repo so forking and cloning is accepted. Alternatively if you have any suggestions for features and or bug fixes please use the email below to contact me.

## Additional notes

1) Debug currently set to TRUE
2) add social media login to installed apps via `https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html`
3) Issue binding port - Authentication and Authorisation functionality - test once deployed
